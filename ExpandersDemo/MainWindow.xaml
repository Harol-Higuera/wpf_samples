                    The first attempt of a Doraemon animated series was in 1973, by Nippon Television. After a January 1973 pilot named Doraemon Mirai Kara Yattekuru (ドラえもんが未来からやってくる, Doraemon Coming from the Future),[53] twenty-six episodes, each with two segments, were broadcast on Nippon TV from April 1 to September 30 of the same year.[54] The series was directed by Mitsuo Kaminashi with voice cast from Aoni Production; the character Doraemon was voiced by Kōsei Tomita, then later by Masako Nozawa.[55] Later in the series, the animation studio, Nippon TeleMovie Productions, went bankrupt, and the masters were sold off or destroyed.[56] The series was re-aired on Nippon TV and several local stations until 1979,[57][58] when Shogakukan requested Toyama Television to cease broadcasting.[59] Some of the segments were found in the archives of IMAGICA in 1995,[60] and some others were recovered by Jun Masami in 2003.[55] As of 2013, 21 of 52 segments have known to survive, two of which without audio.[
